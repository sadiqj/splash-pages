        The <%= link_to "Foundation of Hearts", "http://www.foundationofhearts.org/" %>  is a not-for-profit organisation made up of thousands of Heart of Midlothian FC fans aiming to save the club from liquidation by becoming its majority shareholder. Fans pledge monthly contributions of £10 - £200 to support the purchase.
      </p>

      <p class="para">
        As the Foundation is run by volunteers they “needed a payments provider which was easy for us, and the fans, to use”.

      “GoCardless was the simple option”
      </div>

      <p class="para">
        Having spoken to PayPal and their bank about other payment methods, the Foundation decided on GoCardless as "the simple option".
      </p>

      <p class="para">
        "We chose GoCardless for three reasons: it's easy for our team to use, easy for our supporters to use, and the fees are brilliantly low.”
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        The Foundation integrated with the GoCardless API to allow fans to make pledges through their website. Reporting is provided to the Foundation's team through the API and the GoCardless dashboard.
      </p>

      </h3>
      <div class="section-subheading">
      “The GoCardless team has been fantastic”
      </div>
      <p class="para">
        Using GoCardless has made the payment process much simpler to manage. "I'm not the most technical of people, and even I have found it simple to use.  What's more, the quality of service we've received from the GoCardless team has been fantastic" says Calum, director of the Foundation.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        Within two months of launching with GoCardless, 7,500 fans pledged to support the Foundation.  This has now risen to 8,000 and continues to grow. “We plan to keep expanding, and all pledges will be processed by GoCardless.”
