            <p class="para">There are three ways to use GoCardless:</p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li><strong>Our dashboards</strong> - Set up and manage Direct Debit payments with your customers using our simple online dashboard.</li>
              <li><strong>Our account software partnerships</strong> - We work with a growing list of <a href="/partners" class="u-link-color-p u-text-underline">partners</a>, so you can take payments within the online services you already use.</li>

              Who is GoCardless for?
            </h3>
            <p class="para">Anyone can use GoCardless, but it is particularly great for B2B (business-to-business) and recurring payments.</p>
            <p class="para">We have integrated with many of the most popular accounting packages to enable easy invoicing and payment reconciliation. <br>Find out more <a href="/features" class="u-link-color-p u-text-underline">here</a>.</p>

              What can I not use GoCardless for?
            </h3>
            <p class="para">GoCardless is great for many use cases. However, there are some limitations with our service. We aren't able to:</p>
            <ul class="list">
              <li>
                <strong>Let you take credit card payments</strong> - however you <strong>can</strong> use another payment provider alongside GoCardless.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Let you accept instant payments</strong> - Direct Debit payments take 3-5 working days to clear, so they're not ideal for goods that need
                to be shipped quickly.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Let you accept payments from non-UK bank accounts</strong> - Soon, we'll

              </li>
            </ul>
