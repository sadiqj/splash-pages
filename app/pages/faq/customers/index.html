              How does the GoCardless transaction model work?

              How does GoCardless collect payment from my account?
            </h3>
            <p class="para">GoCardless uses the Direct Debit protocol to collect all payments. This allows us to process payments without using the card networks.</p>

              What if my funds don't reach the merchant?
            </h3>
            <p class="para">GoCardless is not aware of any payment ever failing to reach its destination. However, if this were to occur for any reason you would have a right under the <a href="https://gocardless.com/direct-debit/guarantee/" class="u-link-color-p u-text-underline">Direct Debit Guarantee</a> to charge back to payment.</p>
