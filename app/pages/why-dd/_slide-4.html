      There are some things you don’t want Direct Debit for. It’s not good for paying for your groceries, for example - payments don’t happen instantly, so your customer would already be home by the time you knew if the payment had been successful.
    </p>
    <p class="u-text-s u-color-p u-padding-Tm">
      However for payments where the speed of payment doesn’t matter so much (like subscriptions and invoicing), it's a good idea: Direct Debit has less than half the transaction fees of card payments, and you never lose payments due to card expiry.
