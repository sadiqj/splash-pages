      We make Direct Debit easy

      Until recently it has been quite difficult to get set up on the Direct Debit system. That’s why gas and electricity suppliers tend to use it, but landlords and accountants typically&nbsp;don’t.
    </p>
    <p class="u-text-s u-color-p u-padding-Tm">
      With GoCardless, that's all changed. We make it incredibly simple for anyone to get started with Direct Debit.
    </p>
    <p class="u-text-s u-color-p u-padding-Tm">
      Whether you’re a small business, large enterprise, landlord, accountant or really anyone wanting to collect recurring payments; we’ve made Direct Debit available to anyone.
