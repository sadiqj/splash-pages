          Our web site uses cookies – small text files stored on your computer – in two ways.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          The first is to collect system-related information, such as the type of internet browser and operating system you use, the website from which you have come to our website, the duration of individual page views, paths taken by visitors through the website, and other general information and your IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer on the internet) which is automatically recognised by our web server. This information is collected for system administration and to report aggregate information to our subcontractors and partners to enable them to provide services to us. It is statistical data about our users' browsing actions and does not, of itself, contain any personally identifiable information. It is often not possible to identify a specific individual from this information, although for example we may be able to identify it relates to a specific individual in conjunction with other information in our control.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          The second is that Cookies are also used when registered users access the private sections of our website. Cookies are used to facilitate the log in process. In this case, we may be able to identify that your login details have been used

        <p class="para">
          Most web browsers offer users controls, to give you the option to delete or disable cookies. You can usually find out how to do so by referring to the ‘Help’ option on the menu bar of your browser, or by visiting the browser developer's website. This will usually tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies; notify you when you receive new cookies; and disable cookies altogether. Please note that disabling cookies will stop you accessing private areas of the website.
