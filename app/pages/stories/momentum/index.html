Since opening in May 2013 it has grown to over 250 regular members and is currently looking at opening another site. Before GoCardless, they were using PayPal to collect their membership fees but were looking for a cheaper alternative that was easier to integrate with their membership system.
        </p>
        <p class="u-color-p u-margin-Tm">
          Geoff Stewart, founder of Momentum Training and CrossFit Hackney explains, “PayPal fees were relatively high and it was difficult to integrate so our developers were keen to find a cheaper and easier alternative.”

          Looking for a solution they came across Teamup, a specialist management platform for fitness businesses who recommended using GoCardless to collect their payments. It took minutes to get started; “GoCardless was super easy to integrate. With Paypal we needed a developer to get us set up but we were able to get set up with GoCardless ourselves.”

        <p class="u-color-p u-margin-Tm">
          Momentum Training and CrossFit Hackney now collect their recurring membership fees using GoCardless and use GoCardless and Stripe for their one-off payments.

          Since using Teamup and GoCardless, Momentum Training and Crossfit Hackney have been able to significantly reduce the time they spend on admin and the costs of taking payments from their members – savings which can go towards further growth and improving their business.

        <p class="u-color-p u-margin-Tm">
          Geoff explains: “Taking payments with GoCardless costs us less than half the price of using Paypal and the integration with Teamup has definitely reduced our admin – particularly for dealing with failed payments. It used to be a complicated process to work out which payments had failed and to retry them."
        </p>
        <p class="u-color-p u-margin-Tm">
          "With GoCardless and Teamup any failed payments show up on our dashboard each month and we just need to press a button to retry them instantly. What’s more since moving to Teamup and GoCardless our payment failures are lower than they were before – even though our members have more than doubled.“
