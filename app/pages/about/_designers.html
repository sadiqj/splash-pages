<p class="para">
  Over the past few years, GoCardless' products have allowed small companies to take subscriptions for the first time&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;fundamentally changing the way they do business. But we're not done yet. We've just scratched the surface for small companies, and we want to do the same thing for the biggest organisations on the planet.
