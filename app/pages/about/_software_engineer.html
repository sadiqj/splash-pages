<h3 class="u-text-heading-light u-text-m u-color-heading">Backend Software Engineer</h3>

<p class="para">
  We're looking for backend software engineers to join our growing team.
</p>

<h4 class="u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm">Our work</h4>
<p class="para">We're building a simple, intuitive system on top of Europe's
  broken payments infrastructure. Thousands of merchants already rely on us
  to collect millions of pounds every day.</p>

<p class="para">As an engineering team working in payments, we have to work 
differently:</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>Consistency can't be sacrificed. Wonky data is not an option.</li>
  <li>Availability matters. If we go down, thousands of companies are left
    unable to do business.</li>
</ul>

<p class="para">At the same time, our business is growing at over 700% a year.
  We're ambitious, and we constantly experiment and iterate to drive that growth:</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>
    Working with government and multinational customers to build the next 
    generation of our product.
  </li>
  <li>
    Integrating with new banking systems to expand our offering across Europe.
  </li>
    <li>
    Automating everything from fraud detection to legacy (paper-based) interactions
    with the banks.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm">Our culture</h4>
<p class="para">Payments is a scale business with huge returns to great
  engineering. We have a culture where you can do work that you're proud
  of every day.</p>

<p class="para">We're building a huge company, so we invest time in building
  things well. We keep our technical debt low by regularly refactoring and
  improving our architecture. We know how important it is to be able to move
  fast in the future as well as right now.</p>

<p class="para">Despite the scale of our work, we're a small and friendly team 
  with strong shared values. We get on well and enjoy spending time together, 
  whether working in the office, chatting over lunch or out for drinks after 
  work. We're passionate
  about learning, and we all care deeply about the quality of what we build.
  We regularly run internal tech talks given by both GoCardless employees and 
  industry experts, and we pay for courses &amp; books.</p>

<p class="para">Many of our team are active members of the wider tech community.
  We open source whatever we can, as we did with
  <a class="u-link-color-p u-text-underline" href="https://github.com/gocardless/hutch">Hutch</a> and
  <a class="u-link-color-p u-text-underline" href="https://github.com/gocardless/statesman">Statesman</a>, and we regularly
  host events and meetups in our offices. We have a conference budget for everyone
  on the team and can help with speaker coaching if you're interested.</p>

<h4 class="u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm">Our stack</h4>
<p class="para">We have to stay nimble while delivering mission-critical code.
  To do so we constantly prioritise keeping both our stack and our codebase
  lean.</p>

<p class="para">We build simple, reliable systems on top of technologies we
  understand and trust. We're primarily built in Ruby and JavaScript using
  Rails and Angular, and we rely on Postgres, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ and
  Chef.</p>

<p class="para">We deploy many times a day, supported by a test suite we trust
  and a culture of code review.</p>

<h4 class="u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm">What we're looking for</h4>

<p class="para">We're looking for backend software engineers to join
  our growing team. We'd particularly love you to apply if:</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>
    You're passionate about technology and care deeply about doing work you're proud of.
  </li>
  <li>
    You have opinions about programming languages and experience
    building applications for the web.
  </li>
  <li>
    You have an awareness of the full web stack. You understand the details of HTTP, feel
    comfortable optimising SQL queries, and have experimented with
    JavaScript.
  </li>
  <li>
    You believe that code must be well-tested, and that tests are a helpful
    tool in driving design.
  </li>
</ul>
