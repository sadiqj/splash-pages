<h3 class="u-text-heading-light u-text-m u-color-heading">Engineering Internships</h3>

<p class="para">
  We’re looking for talented, motivated undergrads who want to work on real 
  problems with a world-class team.
</p>

<p class="para">We have paid internships and placements available in our front-end, 
	back-end and web operations teams. If you're passionate about tech, care about 
	learning and finding elegant solutions, and want to work with like-minded 
	engineers, we want to hear from you.
</p>

<h4 class="u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm">Our team</h4>

<p class="para">GoCardless is an ambitious, fast-growing tech startup disrupting 
	the payments industry. We build simple, reliable systems on top of technologies 
	we understand and trust. We're primarily built in Ruby and JavaScript using 
	Rails and Angular, and we rely on Postgres, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ and Chef.
</p>

<p class="para">We're nimble, deploying every day, and we're doing our most 
	ambitious work right now &ndash; working with government and multi-national companies 
	to build GoCardless Pro, and integrating with more banking systems to expand 
	our offering across Europe.
</p>

<p class="para">At the same time we’re already processing millions of pounds of 
	payments every day, so there's no space for inconsistent data or downtime. 
	We maintain reliability while iterating on our product by having a test-suite 
	we can rely on, and prioritising code review.
</p>

<p class="para">As a dev team, learning and mentoring are core to our values: we 
	give our team a generous conference budget and run internal talks on subjects 
	both technical and general. We’re involved in the wider tech community too, 
	regularly hosting meetups and hackdays, and speaking at external events to 
	share our knowledge, skills and passion.
</p>

<h4 class="u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm">Your internship</h4>

<p class="para">You’ll be treated as a fully fledged member of the team from 
	day one, working on interesting, challenging projects that are integral to 
	our product and to the company’s success. You’ll work closely with experienced 
	engineers and we’ll encourage you to learn new technologies and expand your 
	awareness of the full stack.
</p>
 
<p class="para">You’ll also get an insight into how a fast-growing tech company 
	works and how the different areas of our business interact.
</p>

<p class="para">Because you’ll be part of our engineering team, we’re looking 
	for the same qualities and traits that we look for in more senior hires 
	&ndash; but we don’t expect you to have the experience. 
</p>

<h4 class="u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm">You should apply if:</h4>

<ul class="list u-margin-Tm">
  <li>You’re passionate about technology</li>
  <li>You care deeply about doing work you can be proud of</li>
  <li>You’re constantly looking for ways to improve</li>
  <li>You believe that code must be well-tested, and that tests are a helpful 
  	tool in driving design</li>
  <li>You’ve experimented with building applications for the web</li>
</ul>

 <p class="para">We’re particularly interested in hearing about anything you’ve 
	done outside of your studies. For instance, any languages you’ve taught yourself 
	and experimented with; anything you’ve built; meetup groups you’ve attended; 
	hackday projects; anything you’ve done that will show us that you’re 
	excited by technology, curious and ambitious. If you have previous 
	professional experience, we’d love to hear details of the projects you 
	were involved in and what you built.
</p>

<h4 class="u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm">Our interview process</h4>

<p class="para">We’re looking to assess your understanding of the principles of 
	programming; the way you think, learn and respond to feedback; your actual 
	coding skills and whether you’ll flourish here. There are three stages to 
	our interview process:
</p>

<ul class="list">
  <li>a short skype call where we'll cover some background questions and maybe 
  	do a little live coding</li>
  <li>a take-home coding challenge (written in the language of your choice)</li>
  <li>a longer on-site interview, including pair coding, technical questions and
  	a more informal chat</li>
 </ul>

 <p class="para">The whole process is technically-focussed, and we'll ensure that 
 	you meet different engineers at each stage so that you can ask us questions 
 	and get an understanding of what it's like to be part of our team.
 </p>

<p class="para">We’ll consider applicants for internships lasting from 8 weeks 
	up to a year, and we pay a competitive salary.</p>

<p class="para">In your application, you'll be asked to include your CV and a link to 
	your GitHub, as well as telling us about an interesting technical project or 
	problem that you've recently worked on.</p>
