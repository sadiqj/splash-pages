  The role
</h4>

<p class="para">
  We've laid foundations in the UK, and these will 
  guide you as you figure out a strategy that will deliver rapid growth 
  in the Netherlands and Belgium. Then you'll execute this strategy, driving in-country 
  work independently and resourcefully, and swiftly becoming an expert in your 
  market.

<p class="para">
  You will work closely with leaders across the company to understand all product, 
  engineering and operational requirements, so you'll need to be adept at 
  discussing complex situations with a wide variety of audiences. You'll 
  feed your market's needs into our development roadmap to ensure we're always 
  building the product people want.

  All client-facing activities in your market will be your responsibility: planning 
  and delivering on launch activities to build momentum early; accompanying

  PR, sales, partnerships and account management, and start to build a team 
  to support &amp; scale growth in your market.

  whose strengths complement your own to assist you as you forge a path 
  for success in Belgium &amp; the Netherlands.
