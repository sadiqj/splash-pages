  The role
</h4>

<p class="para">
  We've laid foundations in the UK, and these will 
  guide you as you figure out a strategy that will deliver rapid growth 
  in the Netherlands and Belgium. Then you'll execute this strategy, driving in-country 
  work independently and resourcefully, and swiftly becoming an expert in your 
  market.
</p>

<p class="para">
  You will work closely with leaders across the company to understand all product, 
  engineering and operational requirements, so you'll need to be adept at 
  discussing complex situations with a wide variety of audiences. You'll 
  feed your market's needs into our development roadmap to ensure we're always 
  building the product people want. 
</p>

<p class="para">
  All client-facing activities in your market will be your responsibility: planning 
  and delivering on launch activities to build momentum early; accompanying 
  prospective customers from sales to live. You'll handle initial marketing, 
  PR, sales, partnerships and account management, and start to build a team 
  to support &amp; scale growth in your market.
</p>


<p class="para">
  Launching GoCardless in a new territory will require a depth and breadth of 
  skills akin to starting a new company. It's an exciting challenge, and you'll
  benefit from the support and experience of our existing country leads. 
  One of your first tasks will be to start building your team, hiring someone 
  whose strengths complement your own to assist you as you forge a path 
  for success in Belgium &amp; the Netherlands.
