<h3 class="u-text-heading-light u-text-m u-color-heading">Product Engineer</h3>

<p class="para">
  Build and design high-quality products you can take pride in.
</p>

<p class="para">
	We're shaping the way businesses get paid. Our simple, intuitive products have 
	drawn thousands of businesses to rely on us to take care of their payments &ndash; 
	from sole traders to large &amp; multinational companies like the UK Government, 
	Box &amp; TripAdvisor. We pride ourselves on uncluttered interfaces that give 
	our users the power and control they need to manage their payments.
</p>

<p class="para">
	Right now, we're reimagining how enterprise software should work and look. To 
	do this, we're looking for engineers that are strongly user-focussed and care 
	as much about figuring out which features to build as the technical implementation.
</p>

<h4 class="u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm">The role</h4>
<p class="para">
	You'll build the products and features that our users see and interact with. 
	By continually improving the experience of existing products, you'll strengthen 
	our reputation of having the best platform for controlling payments.
</p>

<p class="para">
	You will figure out what capabilities our users really need so that you can 
	streamline interfaces without oversimplifying. You'll incorporate new features 
	in existing products and also build entirely new products, marrying control and 
	simplicity. You'll own your work from inception to release. 
</p>

<p class="para">
	You could be working on anything from our API &amp; docs to user dashboards to 
	internal admin tooling. You'll work closely with both our design team and our 
	back-end engineers, as well as other internal teams like sales &amp; customer 
	support.
</p>

<h4 class="u-text-s u-margin-Bxs u-margin-Tm">Our work</h4>
<p class="para">
	We build simple, reliable products on top of technologies we understand and 
	trust. We are moving to Angular 2.0 for our dashboards and use React where 
	server rendering is needed. We continuously deploy all front-end projects backed 
	by a test-suite we can rely on, and we prioritise code review and constant 
	iteration.
</p>

<p class="para">
	Enterprise software is made up of a huge range of product requirements in one 
	codebase. We make sure that our codebase is something the whole team is proud 
	of. We spend the time to really understand how something should be used before 
	building it, and we keep our code clean.
</p>
