<p class="para">
  As part of its rapid growth, GoCardless is expanding its operations internationally 
  and we are looking for people to lead this. You will be responsible for in-market

  Launching in a new territory requires a depth and breadth of skills akin to 
  starting a company, and you will therefore need to be a relentless 
  problem-solver with in-market experience who works well independently. 
  Ideally you'll have a strong background in operating &amp; scaling a business.
</p>

<p class="para">
  You'll be responsible for figuring out initial operational requirements pre-launch 
  and making sure these are met. You'll design and execute a sales, 
  marketing and partnership strategy which delivers rapid growth. As well as 
  this, you'll be responsible for handling initial sales, support and 
  operations&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;including hiring a team to support &amp; 
  scale in-market growth.

</h4>
<ul class="list">
  <li>
    <strong>Self reliant</strong>: you will have full support of the rest of the company but ultimately, you will be the expert on your market and understand, convince and sell in a different language
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Result-oriented</strong>: starting from scratch, you will raise our visibility in your market, sign contracts and in general demonstrate momentum early on
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Versatile</strong>: you will be able to coordinate local marketing and PR, be effective in client-facing sales, account management and partnership discussions and understand both our products and the client needs inside out
